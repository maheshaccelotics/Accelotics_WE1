          Many years ago, as a young man, I dreamt of an opportunity that will afford people,<br/> regardless of age, gender, socio-economic status, and educational background the<br/> opportunity to realize their life dreams. I was an idealist; I had always believed that <br/>good things are in store for those who are willing to work hard for their dreams.<br/> Although my environment inculcated to my young minds that such was just a myth <br/>and opportunities of that kind didn't exist, I lead on to my hopes.
        </p>
        <p className="para_two">
          Then one day, I stumbled upon this industry called Software Enterprise and <br/>Marketing. As I said "eureka!", I excitingly embarked on the journey of my life. The<br/> dreamer in me, who was yearning for an opportunity to realize my full potential,<br/> found its home. This industry continues to amaze me, with its power to breach <br/>cultural, religious, social, and political barriers and be an equalizer of statuses, it <br/>empowers people to change their lives and their environment.
